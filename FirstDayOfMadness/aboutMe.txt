My first and main profession is a exploring geologist.
I'm trying to learn how to program. This is very important to me.

My key skills, geology aside, include leading and organizing squads, training young professionals, developing technical assignments, moral support, and dealing with work conflicts. I would also include my stubbornness.

I have high expectations of the course, but big self-doubt. I want to gain confident knowledge and find a job in the future. I hope to like it more than frontend. Since I like code, but frontend was killing my motivation a bit. I also want to become smarter, more educated, just within myself and for myself to understand more about the world.

My main hobby is historical fencing. I train and fight in tournaments in HMB and HEMA formats. I fight using spears, axes, and halberds. It pushes me to train and to study history in depth.
Besides that, I've been reading about robotics and drones lately. This is still a very complex but interesting subject.
All this apart from my love of books (especially fantasy and science fiction), nature, music, and more.
